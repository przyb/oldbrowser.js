oldbrowser.js
=============

Simple bar with information, that your old IE version sucks.

For now, it has only polish text on it, but it's simple to customize the copy inside the script. In current version it depends on jQuery. Usage:

<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<!--[if lte IE 8 ]> <script src="/_/js/lib/oldbrowser.js"></script> <![endif]-->

...and done. Bye bye IE users!
